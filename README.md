# Static_WEB_Page_Hosting_from_AWS_S3

In this project, I built a simple website for a store called Colours Boutique. I had made a similar website before using Wix.com during my Master’s degree in the UK, which was focused on project management. Now, I wanted to improve my skills in Python and business analysis, so I decided to create and host this website on AWS S3.

To start, I used templates from a CSS templates website to design the look of the website. I made two main pages for Colours Boutique. Before I began coding, I created an outline using PowerPoint to get an idea of how the website would look. This helped me plan the layout and content for each page.

Next, I set up an AWS S3 bucket, which is like a special folder in the cloud where you can store files. I uploaded all the files I needed for the website, like HTML, CSS, and Python files, into this bucket along with the images needed for that website. I made this folder public by assigning an IPv4 address to it. This means that anyone with the address can see the website. However, I didn’t give the website a proper domain name, like “www.coloursboutique.com.”

The main goal of this project was to learn how to use AWS S3 as a simple server to host a website. By doing this, I gained practical experience in setting up and managing a static website using cloud services.
