# Static_WEB_Page_Hosting_from_AWS_S3

## Project Overview

This project showcases a simple static website for colors boutique, which is built and hosted on Amazon Web Services (AWS) S3.  It demonstrate my ability to:

- Design user interface using design templates.
- Code HTML and CSS for webpages structure and styling.
- Utilizing cloud services like AWS S3 for website hosting.

## Project Goals:

- Gain  practical experience in building and deploying a static website.
- enhance skills in HTML and CSS.
- Learn AWS S3 functionalities for website hosting.

## Development Process:

1. Website Design: Design templates were used to create the visual layout for the colors boutique website.

2. Content Planning: a PowerPoint outline was created to plan the website structure, content organization and page flow.

3. AWS S3 Setup: A S3 bucket was created with the unique name; all the website files are stored in the bucket including HTML AND CSS along with any images if available (In my case I haven't Uploaded any images but I left the space for the image in both home.html and prodcuts.html pages)
